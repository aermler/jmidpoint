Ideas for future versions:

- Seperate threads: gui - calculation
- Export result as text or image
- Tooltips/Documentation
- Grey out button while calculating
- Output of original algorithm without mapping to different classes

Distant future:
- Other algorithms
- 3D output of original algorithm/landscape
